# pedaling_DC_OpenSim
A direct collocation framework for optimal control simulation of pedaling using OpenSim 

This project aims to develop a direct collocation (DC) framework to solve optimal control pedaling problem within the OpenSim modeling environment. This repository includes the OpenSim model, m files, and experimental data that were used in the paper titled as 'A direct collocation framework for optimal control simulation of pedaling using OpenSim'. The optimal results at 31 nodes shown in the paper can be reproduced using the example code.
